# SSH-Honeypot-with-Web-Based-Log-Viewer

This repository features an SSH honeypot implemented in Python using the paramiko library, designed to simulate an SSH server and log unauthorized access attempts along with any commands issued by attackers. Logs are stored in a local file (ssh_honeypot.log) for analysis. Additionally, a Flask-based web application provides a real-time log viewer, allowing users to monitor activity through a clean and simple interface. The honeypot is designed to run on a custom port (default: 2222), and the web interface is accessible via a browser, making it easy to track and analyze
