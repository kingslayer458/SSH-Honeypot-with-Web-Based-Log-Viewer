# SSH-Honeypot-with-Web-Based-Log-Viewer

This repository features an SSH honeypot implemented in Python using the paramiko library, designed to simulate an SSH server and log unauthorized access attempts along with any commands issued by attackers. Logs are stored in a local file (ssh_honeypot.log) for analysis. Additionally, a Flask-based web application provides a real-time log viewer, allowing users to monitor activity through a clean and simple interface. The honeypot is designed to run on a custom port (default: 2222), and the web interface is accessible via a browser, making it easy to track and analyze
Here's a refined GitHub README with enhanced visual presentation and animated elements suggestion:

## 📖 Documentation

### Log Format
```log
2023-08-20 14:30:45 - Connection from 192.168.1.100
2023-08-20 14:31:02 - Command from 192.168.1.100: ls -la
```

### Network Configuration
```python
# Customize in code:
HOST = '0.0.0.0'  # Listen on all interfaces
PORT = 2222       # Non-standard SSH port
```

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important:**  
This honeypot should NEVER be deployed on production systems or exposed to the public internet. Use only in controlled environments for security research purposes.

```diff
- Never use default credentials
- Always run in isolated network
- Regularly review collected logs
```
